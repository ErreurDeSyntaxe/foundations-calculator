# First Entry: The Odin Project Foundations' Final Project

This is the culmination of the past month's efforts. It has been roughly 
thirty days since the beginning of my studies along the TOP path. The
road has been tough at times (flexbox, array methods), and easier at times.
After this project, I will opt for the JavaScript path because it is shorter
and I need to get a job.

The steps for problem solving are Understanding, Planning, Pseudocoding, and
Dividing. Let's start with that today. There might be time for coding the basic
html and CSS.
