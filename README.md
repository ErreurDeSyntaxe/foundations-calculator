# First Entry: The Odin Project Foundations' Final Project

This is the culmination of the past month's efforts. It has been roughly 
thirty days since the beginning of my studies along the TOP path. The
road has been tough at times (flexbox, array methods), and easier at times.
After this project, I will opt for the JavaScript path because it is shorter
and I need to get a job.

The steps for problem solving are Understanding, Planning, Pseudocoding, and
Dividing. Let's start with that today. There might be time for coding the basic
html and CSS.

# Second Entry: Arithmetic and Style

The calculator looks nice (although I just noticed that the space between the
buttons isn't the same left-right and top-bottom). The addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division functions all work well. The operate function that
can call the four previous function works, too. The display and buttons are
completely unresponsive. 

The next step will be to display the numbers when buttons are clicked. Then,
the implementation of the "function buttons (AC, +/-, %). Then, the 
implementation of the operator buttons (+-*/) will follow. That's the 
hardest part of the project according to the lesson.
