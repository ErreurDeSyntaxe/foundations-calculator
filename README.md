# Diary

How much time did I waste on the decimal issue? Why do JavaScript numbers 
behave so weirdly? 4/100/100 = 0.0003999999???

I had to rewrite completely the function that called upon operate(). I am 
unsure what mistake I had written in, but rewriting it was relatively easy,
and it fixed the problem I had. At the time of writing, I don't recall what said
problem was. This is a lesson in writing frequent diary entries, the same way
that I already learned to commit often.
